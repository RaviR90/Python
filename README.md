# 📚 Learning Branch Repository

Welcome to the **Learning** branch! 🚀

This branch is dedicated to maintaining a curated collection of my learning notes, code snippets, and best practices across various technologies. It's designed as both a personal reference and a shared resource for others exploring similar topics.

## 🔍 What's Inside?

Here you'll find organized notes and cheat sheets for:

- 🐍 **Python**: Scripting basics, OOP, libraries, tips & tricks
- 🔥 **Databricks**: Notebooks, Delta Lake, MLflow, PySpark workflows
- ☁️ **AWS**: Services walkthroughs, automation scripts, cost optimization strategies
- ⚙️ **DevOps/CI-CD**: Tools and pipelines I explore along the way
- 📘 **Cheat Sheets**: Quick references for day-to-day work

## 🎯 Why This Branch?

Learning never stops! I'm using this branch to:

- Document hands-on practice and real-world use cases
- Share insights and reusable knowledge with peers
- Reflect progress and simplify future onboarding or troubleshooting
